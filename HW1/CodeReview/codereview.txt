Code Review for caoliyi
by Hongtao Zhao

Review of Data Path:
	Data get stored within the same directory as the python file. 

Review of API Calls:
	API calls happen collectively in one function named "get_all_tweets".

Review of Code Conventions:
	Conventions are generally good in terms of syntax. 
  
Review of Program Readability:
	The workflow is very clear and the comments are enough for other people to understand.
  If she can pack up different functions together in a 'def', it will be great.
  I'm afraid I can't say her code is perfect because there are too many blank lines. For example, #81 to #85 are blank, 
  which are unnecessary.
  
Issues:
  I downloaded caoliyi's repository for API exercise and tried to run her final version: final3.py
  There was an error with Google version API with messages as follow:

  google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: Could not automatically determine credentials. 
  Please set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS or explicitly create credential and re-run the application. 
  For more information, please see https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials.

  The reason is she didn't figure out the path of the json file which is for certification. 
  So I added 'os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "/usr/local/lib/googlecloudsdk/cert.json"' in the line #87 
  and her code was able to run without error.
  Maybe this issue only happen in certain operating systems but if the certification file's path is defined in the code, 
  it will save my time to debug.

Performance:
  This program is able to download images from Twitter, get the images' description and generate two videos for the jpg and 
  png files.
